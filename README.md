# My movies app ðŸŽ¥
This app was developed in the SE program at Masterschool.

Its an CLI tool to list, add, delete movies from an SQLite database, show different statistics, find movie by title and get a random movie to enjoy your evening.

Newly added movies just require a title, the rest of the data gets fetched from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). (You need an API key, which is not provided in this repo)
